Readme for ColorMachineLibrary (CML)
------------------------------------

CML is a self-contained implementation of color transformations used in
scientific color science and standards, based on informations from the
literature and reference material from standartization institutes.



Usage:
------

Create a static or dynamic library with the contents of src/CML. There is
a Visual Studio project prepared for that in that folder.

You only need to include "CML.h" to work with the C API. For the C++ API, you
can include "ColorClasses/CMLColor.h"

Have a look at the examples in the src folder!
